# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for Connection Issues

## Current Status:
âœ… Backend is running on port 3001
âœ… Network configuration is correct (Chain ID 8080)
âœ… API endpoints are working

## To Fix the Connection Issues:

### 1. Refresh the Frontend
Since I made several fixes to the API calls and network handling, refresh your browser:
- Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+R` (Mac)
- Or hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`

### 2. Open Developer Console
Press `F12` to keep the console open and watch for any remaining errors.

### 3. Test the Connection
1. **Connect Wallet**: The button should now work better
2. **Check Console**: You should see logs like "Already on correct network" if you're on Chain ID 8080
3. **Browse Quests**: The quests should now load from the backend

### 4. If Still Having Issues:
The most common fix is to **restart the frontend**:
```bash
# In the frontend terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
npm start
```

## Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Network helper popup should only show if you're NOT on Chain ID 8080
- âœ… Quests should load without connection errors  
- âœ… Wallet connection should work smoothly
- âœ… Console should show network detection logs

## Debug Information:
From your screenshot, I can see:
- Chain ID `0x1f90` is correct (that's 8080 in decimal)
- The errors were related to API calls failing
- All API calls are now using relative URLs with the proxy
